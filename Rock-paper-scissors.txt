Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game! Scratchers edition 😉
In this game, you just have to play rock, paper or scissors. But always make sure that your palm faces towards the camera. It does not work otherwise because I 
just used normal hand logic.
In case you don't know how to play rock paper scissors, close your palm with your thumb outside. For scissors, make sure that your index and middle fingers are
raised and facing upwards. For paper, open your palm. Always make sure to face your palm towards the camera. Thank you for reviewing my project :D
