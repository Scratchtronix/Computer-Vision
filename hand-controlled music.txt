This is an overview of what this mini-project is going to be:

WARNING: Before you use the program, make sure to always align your hand in a perfect angle for the camera. This is just my
first program, so not many enhancements!

Webcam: Detects and processes frames
The Mediapipe model: Detects hand gestures and plays music based on them.

Key features:
Thumbs up: Next song
Thumbs down: Previous song
Palm closed completely: Song pauses
Palm open: Song resumes

Music controller:
This music is controlled by the pygame.mixer.music function.
