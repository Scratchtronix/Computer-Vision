This is the text file of the OCR Translation mini-project. This mini-project is probably one of the easiest out of all the others :). I used the chatgpt api key
to translate the text because I find it to be more efficient. Please just type in the language you want to translate the text to and voila! This is just the
beginning of my learning stage in computer vision and I plan to do much more! Also, make sure to create your own API key in the openai website and have your own
sample image to test it with.
