# Computer Vision Mini Projects

This is just a collection of small, real-time computer vision projects I have built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, OCR, and related AI libraries.
This repository is where I experiment, learn, and build practical computer-vision tools. This is basically my online laboratory!

Current Projects (10 Total)
1. Emotion Meter

Detects a user's facial expression in real time and displays the identified emotion.

2. Rock–Paper–Scissors (Hand Signs)

Play RPS against the webcam using MediaPipe Hands to classify hand signs.

Extracts text from webcam or images using OCR and translates it into another language.

7. Face/Hand Sign Password System

Unlocks an application using either facial recognition or a predefined hand gesture.

8. Hand-Gesture Movie Guessing Game

User performs gestures related to a movie, and the AI attempts to guess the movie.

9. Reaction Time Tester

A simple tool that measures how quickly users react to a visual change on screen.

10. Text Translator (OCR)

Reads visible text using OCR and translates it in real time.
